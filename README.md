# Project #1: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun—**a game!**

Javascript games are **simple** projects with **well-defined** functionality that give you the opportunity to apply your new programming and DOM manipulation skills.

Your priority here is to practice Javascript and programming concepts. We strongly recommend you use a simple, pre-existing game concept that gives you plenty of time to build strong Javascript practices instead of a highly unique game that bogs you down in complicated design and mechanics.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Proposal

**Your Project must be approved before you start coding.** Your instructor will need to see and approve your user stories and wireframes, and will want you to have an idea of the organization of your app before your start.  This may require you to go back to the drawing board.  The instructor will help you make sure that you scoped out an achievable **MVP** (minimum viable product; a project simple enough that you think can be built well ahead of a given deadline) that is well-defined, along with a few nice-to-haves and stretch goals. 


### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* **HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.**
* **Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README** 
* **Wireframes:** - Draw out the various what your game will look like by sketching various screens. Some wireframe tools:
    1.  Pen/pencil & paper!
    2.  Adobe XD
    3.  InVision
* **User Stories** - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
    1.  When the user click starts and the memory game starts.
    2.  When the user clicks a card, the card flips over.
    3.  When the user matches all pairs of cards, the game ends.
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players, if your game doesn't make sense for two players talk to your local instructor about it.
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **JavaScript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* Be reasonably complex

### Necessary Deliverables

* A working MVP containing the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game; do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with an explanation of what the project is and why you made it, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable).  In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, element inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* During the day, work through problems in class & **ask questions when you need to!** We're here to help prevent you from burning through your time with wild goose chases. Add relevant code to your game each night too, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. There should be _at least_ a couple dozen commits. 
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Plan to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

#### Sample Project Ideas

#### Tamagotchi
Create your own personal Tamagotchi (feel free to find image assets online or make your own). Add functionality to feed your Tamagotchi, play with it, and put it to sleep - without these three healthy habits, your Tamagotchi may get sick or pass away :(

#### Blackjack/Poker
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

#### Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

#### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

#### Connect Four
Two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The discs occupying the lowest available space within the column. Whoever connects four discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
#### Hangman
A classic guessing game where the user tries to guess a random word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

1. **Blackjack**
1. **Simon** (warning: will require asynchronous timing)
1. **Slot Machine**

#### Little more challenging

1. **Minesweeper**
1. **Roulette**
1. **Checkers** (no AI required - player vs. player is fine)
1. **Solitaire**
1. **Battleship** (would require a little AI to implement a computer opponent)

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things  Javascript)_
* **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes and other tasks as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### Due Dates
1. Your planning materials are due by Monday, January 25th, 2021 and will be submitted using a Google Form distributed by your instructors.
1. You will present your project, in whatever form it's currently in (working, buggy, or broken), on Friday, January 29th, 2021.

### Resubmission Policy
All students in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive are permitted to resubmit one (1) project that does not meet expectations over the course of their 12-week cohort. Students are required to pass all projects in order to continue in the course. Failing a project may jeopardize a student's eligibility to graduate and recieve post-course career support.
